Permissions at higher levels are 'Field Level' permissions. All Fields have a 'Permission Level' set against them and the rules defined at that permissions apply to the field. This is useful in case you want to hide or make certain field read-only for certain Roles.,
"Permissions at level 0 are 'Document Level' permissions, i.e. they are primary for access to the document.",
